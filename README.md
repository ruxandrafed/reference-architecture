### Embody our [Principles][digital-principles]

- Focus on Customer First
- Value data over opinions
- Deliver outcomes over outputs
- Take risks and be lean
- Build for quality and reuse
- Be an owner
- Attract and develop leaders
- Embrace inclusivity
- Strengthen communities

### Open Source

Because we love our customers and we love our technology, we are evolving it, in full transparency!

<!--lint disable no-emphasis-as-heading-->
**We do all of this in public to truly embrace our _customer first_ principles**

In order to achieve this, we ensure no sensitive content is included, such as:

- security & privacy policy violating content
- content considered competitive intelligence
- keys, tokens or credentials

### Process & Contribution

To ensure open collaboration and support for wiki contributions, a few avenues are made available:

- [**Technology Forum**][technology-forum]  
  The Technology Forum is the official discussion board for conversations around
  technology solutions, ideas, issue escalations, questions, knowledge sharing,
  and Reference Architecture evolution.

  > Since Reference Architecture is open source, we separated Technology Forum into
  > its own private repository for deep technical discussions and confidential information.

- **Open Contribution**  
  Use GitHub to create pull-requests, start discussions, and contribute to active issues.
  Your contributions should also be addressed in _The Technology Forum_ in order to be considered for adoption. 

  If you are ready to start contributing, here are some things to keep in mind:
  - This a versioned documentation repository, and commit messages follow the [karma format][karma-format].
  - If you are adding new documentation or updating existing documentation, you should format your commits following this model: `docs(<scope>): added/updated standards about <scope>`. 
  - If you are adding major sections or introducing major changes, then consider marking your commit as a breaking change.
  - If you are only making corrections or fixing style/layout/punctuation/grammar, etc., then follow this model: `style(<scope>): fix grammar issues in <scope> docs`.
  - For all other commits, follow the above mentioned Karma conventions.
  - Feel free to consult our [CONTRIBUTING](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more guidance on how to contribute.

#### Local development setup

If you want to make sure your changes will pass our CircleCI steps, you might want to run things locally:

```bash
npm run lint
```

In order to setup everything needed to run all of the checks locally, please run the script below. This will install locally all of the dependencies needed and mirror the CI setup:

```bash
npm run setup-local
```

### Format

All topics MUST adhere to the format outlined in [this template](.template.md)

### GitHub

Using the GitHub repository itself, rather than the "GitHub Wikis" feature, or other "Wiki" software ensures:

- version tracking, and usage of GitHub GUI features _(blame, history, branches, diff, etc ...)_
- ability to publish into a static website using GitHub Pages
- leverage branch locking, testing automation and other GitHub features only available in repos

### Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14][bcp14] [[RFC2119][rfc2119]] [[RFC8174][rfc8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
